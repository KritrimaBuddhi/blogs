This blog is designed as a utilitarian space for sharing technical notes, ideas, and solutions — with zero emphasis on aesthetics or visual presentation. There’s no attempt to make the site look polished or impressive; in fact, design has been entirely set aside in favor of simplicity and focus. It’s meant to be a bare, functional knowledge base that prioritizes clarity, quick updates, and easy referencing.

Each post follows a structured approach: it explores the underlying technology or concept, evaluates real-world use cases, measures key factors like scalability, complexity, cost, reliability, and flexibility, and highlights relevant trade-offs. Finally, it offers practical recommendations based on this analysis. The goal is to produce content that’s clear, useful, and immediately applicable — without any distractions from form or flair.
